- 👋 Hi, I’m @BobVe
- 👀 I’m interested in stereoscopic 3D video using GoPro Hero 11 cameras. Initially thought sync should be close enough at 240fps, but would like to improve on that with timecode sync. Still exploring solutions whether through gopro labs, or OEM timecode generators. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to design beamsplitters. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making stereoscopic 3D movies and documentaries.

- ⚡ Fun fact: won artistic achievement award from Nat'l Stereoscopic Assoc in 2011 for timelapse of nighttime carnival rides. Numerous awards in international 3D photography exhibitions, recognition in Photographic Society of America's Who's Who.
